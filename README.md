# Inclusive Web Design Checklist

Aims to be the **biggest** checklist of inclusive design considerations for the web _ever_. Includes items for accessibility, performance, device support, interoperability, and language. Pull requests welcome!

- [ ] Minify CSS and JS, and remove unused/redundant code [[#1](https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/MinifyResources)]

- [ ] Use textual labels to make voice activation cues obvious
- [ ] Do not mark up subheadings/straplines with separate heading elements

- [ ] Provide a print stylesheet (single column, with interactive content hidden)
- [ ] Use well-established, therefore recognizable, icons and symbols

- [ ] Inform the user when there are important changes to the application state
- [ ] Make sure the purpose of a link is clearly described: "read more" vs. "read more about accessibility"
